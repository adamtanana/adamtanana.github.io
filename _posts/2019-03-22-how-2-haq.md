Talk 1/n for UNSW SecSoc on basic into to binary exploitation

Prereqs to reading this
---------------------------

1. Assume you know how to write and compile C code
2. Assume you are somewhat familiar with `gcc` and the linux command line
3. Would help to have some knowledge of gdb & assembly but not required
4. This will cover linux 32bit stuff

How to haq
------------------

1. How does C work
2. How do computers work
3. How do I break computers

Fast forward to part 3
--------------------------

A few questions before we start

1. What does the following code do
2. What's wrong with it?
3. How can we, without changing the source, call the function `notcalled()`?

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void notcalled() {
    printf("What\n");
}

void echo() {
    char buffer[16];

    printf("Enter some text\n");
    gets(buffer);
    printf("You entered %s\n", buffer);
}

int main() {
    echo();
    return 0;
}
```

Back to part 2: How do computer work?
---------------------------------

Let's start with some basics

* What is memory?
* What is a stack?
* How does it work?
* What is assembly?

Photoshoot time...
