How does C work?
------------------------------------

Look carefully at the boilerplate code below, what does each line actually represent?

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[], char* envp[]) {
   printf("pls haq me\n"); 
}
```

* What does each line actually do?
* What is envp?
* What happens when I don't put envp???

How do i compile it

`gcc -o test test.c`

What does this actually generate?<br />
What's inside `test`

* Marks pointer test

How do computer work?
---------------------------------

* What is assembly?
* How does it work?

How do I break computers?
